      I had just heard about rust+wasm shortly after getting into rust and I
      remembered
      <a href="https://youtu.be/DEqXNfs_HhY">this</a>
      video by Lex Fridman. I drew inspiration and decided to make a rendered
      donut as my first project.

      I don't think this method is terribly efficient and I'm not even sure if
      it's more performant than it would be if I wrote it all in JavaScript,
      but it was fun to complete and it works (at least on my setup :P).
